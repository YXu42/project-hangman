# Hangman (Pseudocode)

```
Player 1 chooses a word
Ask player 2 for a letter
Player 2 chooses a letter
Check if the letter is found in the word
If the letter is in the word, display the letter
If the letter is not in the word, display a part of the body and the letter in a separate list
If player 2 chooses all the letters in the word, they win
If the whole body is displayed before player 2 chooses all the letters, they lose
Game ends
